This project controls an arduino mounted on a toy boat with a smart phone over bluetooth.The components used in this project are arduino uno board, bluesmirf silver bluetooth module from sparkfun, ardumoto motor sheild from sparkfun , 4.8V battery (which came with the boat) and smartphone with minimum android 4.1 installed. The connections have been made as per the schematic provided on the project webpage.
The android application for controlling the toy boat has been developed without the use of any "of the shelf" libraries.The application will not startup untill the bluetooth on the phone has been switched "on".Also, intuitive messages or toasts will be displayed if the device is not in range or the smartphone does not support bluetooth.
The screen when the app is installed has 5 buttons on it.The buttons make the board go forward,reverse,left,right and stop.Reverse is included to avoid the boat crashing on the walls of the pool during testing.
